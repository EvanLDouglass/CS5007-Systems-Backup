# CS 5007: Systems
This repo serves as a backup for my Systems class at Northeastern University Seattle. Note that everything in this repo, besides the README, was written in vim from a virtual machine running a server version of Ubuntu, in part to replicate a cloud development environment. 

Work from the second half of this class, starting from the a6 directory, all builds on the previous week's work, the end product being a Client-Server movie search engine.
Each week we were given some starter code and asked to complete it.
The following week's starter code included the code we had just written (except we were given versions that were completed by the professors, so those who didn't finish the assignment could still do the next one).
We started by building a linked list and a hashtable, then used those to build higher level abstractions that resulted in the movie search engine.
