# Questions from TODO tags

I have entered TODO questions as I came across them while completing this assignment.
Each flag is shown as it is in the code with an answer below.

In FileParser.c:<br\>
```c
// TODO: How to choose?
int numFields = 1000;
```
The numFields variable is being used to set the length of an array of strings.
